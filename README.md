## About
The main objective of this project was to check if PCA applied to higlhy colinear data (bankruptcy prediction with financial indicators task) can improve overall Neural Network performance. This project was about modelling and learnt models application rather than data analysis. Nevertheless some preprocessing was carried out - decoding, balance and missings check. It turned out that there were many missings in this data, to handle it special data imputation algorithm was developed (which I'm very proud of and I decided to use it in my Master Thesis).
